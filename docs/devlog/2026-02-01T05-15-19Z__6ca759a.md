Message: feat: run generation on container start

## Changes

- Created `generator/scripts/entrypoint.sh` to run `node src/index.js` (generation check) *before* starting the cron daemon.
- Updated `generator/Dockerfile` to use this new entrypoint script.
- This ensures that if the container starts and data is missing for the current day, it is generated immediately, solving the "first run" empty data issue.

## Tests

- Verified `src/index.js` has idempotency logic (it does), so running it on start won't double-generate or overwrite if data exists.

## Issues

- None
