Message: fix: copy web assets into docker image

## Changes

- Modified `docker-compose.yaml` to use build context `.` (root) for `web` service.
- Modified `web-server/Dockerfile` to copy `web` directory into `/app/public` inside the image.
- Removed the local bind mount for `./web` in `docker-compose.yaml` (commented out).
- This ensures that the Docker image is self-contained and works correctly in deployments (like Coolify) where bind mounts might not behave as expected or when shipping the image alone.

## Tests

- Ran `docker compose build web` -> Success.
- Verified `COPY web ./public` layer exists in the build output.

## Issues

- None
