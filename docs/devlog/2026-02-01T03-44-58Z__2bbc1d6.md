Message: feat: operational polish

## Changes

- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive documentation:
  - Architecture overview
  - Local development steps
  - Deployment instructions (Coolify)
  - Operations (Schedule, Troubleshooting)
- Updated `scripts/healthcheck.sh`:
  - Uses `node` to parse JSON for robustness
  - Checks `/`, `/data/latest.json`, and the specific daily file
- Verified `generator` logs (already implemented in `src/index.js`)

## Tests

- Ran `scripts/healthcheck.sh` -> Passed
- Ran `docker compose up` -> Services running
- Verified `.gitignore` correctly excludes data files

## Issues

- None
