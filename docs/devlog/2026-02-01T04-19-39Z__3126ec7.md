Message: fix: replace dummy data with realistic samples

## Changes

- Updated `data/daily/2026-02-01.json` and `2026-02-02.json` with realistic uplifting messages and complete translations (all 20 languages).
- Updated themes for these sample dates to demonstrate UI theming capabilities.

## Tests

- Manual verification of JSON structure (files written successfully).
- These files are "test data" for local development until the user configures API keys.

## Issues

- None
